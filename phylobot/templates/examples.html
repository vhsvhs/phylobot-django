<h3><a href="/VATPase">&#10140; Vacuolar-type H+-ATPase V0 Domain Hexameric Ring</a></h3>
<p>The vacuolar H1-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit protein complex that pumps hydrogen ions across
membranes to acidify subcellular compartments. This library reconstructs the shared ancestors of subunits
3, 11, and 16 in the hexameric ring found in the V0 domain of the complex. This library was
used in the publication <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7381/full/nature10724.html">Finnigan and Hanson-Smith (Nature 2012).</a></p>

<h3><a href="/Mcm1Arg80">&#10140; Mcm1 MADS-box Transcriptional Regulator</a></h3>
<p>Mcm1 and its paralog Arg80 are DNA-binding proteins that regulate the transcription of yeast genes
involved in diverse functions, including mating and arginine biosynthesis. This library was
used in the publication <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/104">Baker, Hanson-Smith, and Johnson (Science 2013).</a></p>

<h3><a href="http://www.phylobot.com/cmgc">&#10140; CMGC Protein Kinase Family</a></h3>
<p>The CMGC family of serine/threonine kinases phosphoregulates the activity of many important
cellular functions across Eukaryotes. This ancestral library
was used in the publication <a href="http://elifesciences.org/content/3/e04126">Howard and Hanson-Smith (eLife 2014)</a>, although
the current version of the library now includes expanded sampling of the CDK family.</p>

<h3><a href="/alp/">&#10140; Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) and AP-Like Proteins</a></h3> 
<p>AP is an enzyme that removes phosphate groups from many types of molecules. This library
was built in collaboration with <a href="http://www.fordycelab.com/">the Fordyce Lab</a> 
and <a href="http://cmgm.stanford.edu/herschlag/">the Herschlag Lab</a> at Stanford.</p>

<h3><a href="/alpha1/">&#10140; Mating-Type Alpha 1 Transcriptional Regulator</a></h3> 
<p>MATalpha1 is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the transcription of mating genes in yeast.
This library was built in collaboration with <a href="http://johnsonlab.ucsf.edu">the Johnson Lab at UCSF</a>.</p>
