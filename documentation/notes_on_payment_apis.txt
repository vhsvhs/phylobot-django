Notes on Payment APIs for Django

1. Django Paywall

Django Paywall (DP) provides a way to control access to resources defined in the url_settings of the Django project. My understanding is that DP is not well suited to the needs of PhyloBot because DP does not provide a mechanism to bill  users after their job completes, with a charge based on the job size.

2. Stripe and Django
