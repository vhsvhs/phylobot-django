Notes on Payment APIs for Django

1. Django Paywall

Django Paywall (DP) provides a way to control access to resources defined in the url_settings of the Django project. My understanding is that DP is not well suited to the needs of PhyloBot because DP does not provide a mechanism to bill  users after their job completes, with a charge based on the job size.

2. Stripe and Django

2a. Requirements:
- DB tables to store the sale
- A form that will validate credit card details
- A template to display the form, with errors
- The Stripe Python library

2b. Coding:
- Add STRIPE_API_KEY to settings.py

2c. Using Stripe.js to be PCI compliant

--> I need to store CC numbers long-term. Is stripe.js the right solution?

Solution?: use stripe.js to create a Customer object, and store the customer token for later.


3. Key Terms:
* The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
