# PhyloBot Server Setup Instructions
#
# Follow these instructions to setup a PhyloBot server running on Amazon EC2.
#

Instructions:

0. Create an account on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Familiarize yourself with AWS
	services, including EC2, S3, SQS, and SES.

1a. In the AWS console, launch an instance from the AMI 'ami-33bc5877'. This instance
	will be the new PhyloBot server.
	
1b. After the instance is running, find its public IP address.
	The IP is usually found in the 'Description' tab.

2a. Login into the server:
	$> ssh -i ~/.ssh/KEYPATH ubuntu@PUBLICIP
	
	. . . where KEYPATH is the security key for the instance (.e.g., phylobot-ec2-key.pem),
	and PUBLICIP is the IP address of the instance launched in #1,
			
2b. Update the PhyloBot code. PhyloBot is already installed in the AMI, 
	so we simply need to update the git repo with the latest revisions.
	$> cd phylbot-django
	$> sudo git pull
	$> cd ~/

3. Copy a .boto file to the server from your local machine. The .boto file
	contains the aws_access_key_id and the aws_secret_access_key. This information
	will be used by the BOTO API to access AWS on your behalf.
	Do the following on your local machine (i.e., not on the remote PhyloBot):
	$> cd ~/
	$> scp -i ~/.ssh/KEYPATH ~/.boto ubuntu@PUBLICIP:~/

3b. Copy a .phylobot file to the server from your local machine. The .phylobot file
	contains hardcoded constants for AWS, including names of buckets, zones, and 
	AMI IDs.
	$> cd ~/
	$> scp -i ~/.ssh/KEYPATH ~/.phylobot ubuntu@PUBLICIP:~/

3c. Copy the PhyloBot key onto the new server. (Do this from your local machine).
	$> scp -i ~/.ssh/KEYPATH ~/.ssh/phylobot-ec2-key.pem ubuntu@PUBLICIP:~/.ssh/

3d. Return to the PhyloBot server and load the .phylobot file
	$> source ~/.phylobot

4. Run the PhyloBot Server Setup Script
	$> sudo bash phylobot-django/aws_setup/setup_phylobot_server_on_aws.sh

4a. You will be prompted to create a superuser for the Django portal. Select
	an admin name and password at the prompt.
	
5. Launch the Job Daemon.
	$> screen
	$> # Use cd to navigate to the PhyloBot repository
	$> python job_daemon.py
	
	Then exit screen (control-A-D).

5a. If no errors were reported, then PhyloBot is now running at the PUBLICIP.

6. Optional: If you're cloning PhyloBot from another instance, then run the 
	migration script to copy all the static data, databases, and BOTO configurations.
	$> sudo bash aws_setup/migrate.sh
	
7. Restart Apache.
	$> sudo service apache2 restart
	
8. Done!
